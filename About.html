          <p>
            Founded in 2005 by a team of forward-thinking legal experts, STACKLY
            was established with a singular goal: to modernize the practice of
            law. We recognized that the traditional model often failed to keep
            pace with the rapid advancements in technology and finance. Our
            first office in New York quickly became a hub for innovative legal
            solutions, primarily focusing on complex litigation and emerging
            market compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past two decades, STACKLY has grown from a boutique
            practice into a multinational firm, yet we retain the core values of
            accessibility and dedication. Our growth is a testament to our
            philosophy of building long-term, strategic partnerships with our
            clients, guiding them through every legal challenge with precision
            and foresight.

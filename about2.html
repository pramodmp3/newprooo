            <p>
              Founded in 2015 by a small team of legal innovators and
              developers, our company was born from a simple frustration: why
              were attorneys forced to choose between complex, siloed systems
              and outdated manual processes? We set out to create intuitive,
              unified technology—starting with our flagship CLIO (Consultation)
              and MYCASE (Case Management) products.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through years of rapid growth, key product expansions (including
              the powerful Analytics suite), and continuous collaboration with
              the legal community, we have grown into a trusted global partner.
              Our journey is defined by relentless innovation and an unwavering
              commitment to making complex legal challenges manageable and
              scalable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we proudly empower thousands of legal professionals
              worldwide, but our startup ethos remains: agility, curiosity, and
              a deep dedication to customer success and simplifying the practice
              of law.
